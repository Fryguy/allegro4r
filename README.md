# Allegro4r

A Ruby FFI binding to the [Allegro](http://liballeg.org) game programming library.

## Installation

- [Install Allegro](https://wiki.allegro.cc/index.php?title=Getting_Started#Installing_Allegro)

- Install the Ruby gem

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'allegro4r'
```

And then execute:

Or install it yourself as:

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
