== ALLEGRO LICENSE:

Allegro is gift-ware. It was created by a number of people working in
cooperation, and is given to you freely as a gift. You may use, modify,
redistribute, and generally hack it about in any way you like, and you do not
have to give us anything in return.

However, if you like this product you are encouraged to thank us by making a
return gift to the Allegro community. This could be by writing an add-on
package, providing a useful bug report, making an improvement to the library,
or perhaps just releasing the sources of your program so that other people can
learn from them. If you redistribute parts of this code or make a game using
it, it would be nice if you mentioned Allegro somewhere in the credits, but
you are not required to do this. We trust you not to abuse our generosity.
